# Content Translation Library
Bhashini-Translation is a robust language translation library specifically designed to cater to the translation needs of Indian languages. Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (AI), this library offers accurate and efficient translation services. Its primary purpose is to provide developers with a seamless way to integrate advanced language translation capabilities into their web applications. By utilizing Bhashini-Translation, developers can enhance their applications with multilingual support, enabling users to access content in different languages.

One of the key features of Bhashini-Translation is its integration with the Bhashini API. The Bhashini API serves as the backend service that performs the actual translation tasks. It acts as an intermediary between the client-side application and the AI-powered translation engine. Developers can make API calls to the Bhashini API to request translations for different language pairs and texts.

[Bhashini Api](https://bhashini.gitbook.io/bhashini-apis/). It seamlessly integrates with web frontends such as Vanilla JS, React, and Angular.  
Bhashini follows [ISO-639 series](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) of language codes.
