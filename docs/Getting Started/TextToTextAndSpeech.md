# Text To Text And Speech Translation
Bhashini-Translation is a powerful language translation library designed specifically for Indian languages. It harnesses the power of AI to offer accurate and efficient translation services. With Bhashini-Translation, you can easily integrate advanced language translation capabilities into your web applicationsIt's integrating with [Bhashini Api](https://bhashini.gitbook.io/bhashini-apis/). It seamlessly integrates with web frontends such as Vanilla JS, React, and Angular.  
Bhashini follows [ISO-639 series](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) of language codes.

Users can first input text into the text area, then choose to either have the text translated into a different language or converted into speech (or both). This could be particularly useful for scenarios where users want to communicate with someone who speaks a different language or want to listen to content rather than reading it.
